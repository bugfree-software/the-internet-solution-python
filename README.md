The Internet solution in Python
============================

Automation of test cases from http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ using Helium (http://heliumhq.com/) in Python.

## How to test The Internet?

To run the tests, fork the repository, go into the main directory and run the following from command prompt/terminal:

```

```

Please remember to have Helium downloaded & installed before-hand (put on PYTHONPATH), as described here: http://heliumhq.com/docs/getting_started.
